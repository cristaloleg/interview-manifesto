# Interview manifesto

...or how to drive your interview and hire people. Based on real life examples and experience.

## General

0. Etiquette

- Say hello!
- Ask how is a candidate?
- Is everything okay?
- Suggest a water/coffee/tea/juice/etc.
- Simple things to make a situation less stressful.

1. Introduce yourself

- Every interview is a stress for a candidate (and also for an interviewer).
- Make the situation more enjoyable.
- Try to make it comfy and relaxed.
- To make this - start a simple dialog.
- Introduce yourself.
- What is your experience?
- Describe your current project.
- How long do you work here?
- What makes it cool?
- (Maybe) what can be done better?

2. Ask about candidates experience

- That's a starting point to understand who is in front of you.
- CV is a good thing, same as Github, Stackoverflow or personal blog.
- But during real conversation you will get much more details.
- Off course if you will ask for them.

3. What technologies are you familiar with?

- You will see how deep or wide candidates knowledge is.
- What parts of your language/framework sucks?
- What other technologies are you interested in but don't have ability to try?
